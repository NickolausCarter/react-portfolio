            <p>I am a web developer and U.S. Army Veteran with over 20 years of experience in human intelligence collection and analysis.</p>
            <p>During my time in the military, I led teams ranging from 4 to 24 members that were often spread across various locations in the US, Europe, Africa, and Asia. I have a passion for working as a member of a team to dissect complex problems, develop creative solutions, and achieve unique results.</p>
            <p>I have had a strong interest in technology and computing since I was a child and have been building my own computers as a hobby for about 20 years. I'm excited to work with a motivated team in order to develop applications that can be used to enhance people's daily lives!</p>
            <p>I recently earned a certificate from the University of Texas in full stack web development that included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN Stack. I recently enrolled at Western Governors University to continue my higher education and obtain a B.S. Cyber Security and Information Assurance.</p>
